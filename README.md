# AppDash


## Project starter, using Vue.js + Router, Vuex and Vuetify + Firebase Auth

## Objective
The objective was to create a starting point for an application, and a resource for others, who like me, wanted to develop a simple app, but started off with no knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, CSS or front end Web frameworks.

## What is it?
AppDash is a mobile first starter Web app. It does the things that most apps do no matter what their business purpose is. It has things like the a title bar, footer, navigation and navigation routes, error handling, the ability to create new users, to sign in existing users, make a user profile, and give users some control over the look and feel of the app. All this with a structure and architecture that make it possible to grow into a service based app, without turning it into a monolith.

## Demo Account
Log in using these credentials:
Email: dg@example.com
Password: 123123

## Configuration
The Firebase configuration is in src/fb.js.

## Future Work
I might not have achieved the objective. There is plenty of work left to do, and what I have done might be all wrong. I hope that by putting it out here now, I will get direction (be gentle :- ) and maybe some help.
